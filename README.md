# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on the Amazon Vine program and the quality of the reviews that it produces. Vine members are provided products in which they are asked to review. Companies pay a small fee to participate in this program to increase exposure or engagement on their respective products. This analysis is tasked with reviewing the quality of these reviews.

•	The results of the analysis returned that there were 47 vine reviews and 8,343 non-Vine reviews.
•	There is a total of 15 five-star Vine reviews and 4,318 five-star non-Vine reviews.
•	The percentage of 5 five-star Vine reviews totaled to 32% whereas the percentage of five-star non-Five was approximately 52%

## Summary

According to the results, 15 of the 47 Vine reviews were5 stars, which equates to approximately 32% of the total reviews provided by this program. Conversely, approximately 52% of the non-Vine reviews were five-star reviews. The 32% represents a large bias of five-star reviews in the Vine program. However, when compared to that of the non-Vine program, the five-start reviews hold a much greater weight of 52%. This may be specific to this industry, but it is hard to tell if the Vine reviews are truly a bias due to the nature in which they are provided, or if this is typical consumer behavior when compared to the non-Vine reviews. Additional analysis of the datasets in the other categories would provide additional insight in the review patters of Vine verse non-Vine consumers.
